As such, they are most valuable for the plugin maintainers themselves.","permalink":"/moodledevdocs/general/community/plugincontribution/codeprechecks"},{"id":"community/plugincontribution/index","title":"Plugin contribution","description":"This page describes how to contribute your code into the Plugins directory to share it with the Moodle community.","permalink":"/moodledevdocs/general/community/plugincontribution/"},{"id":"community/plugincontribution/checklist","title":"Plugin contribution checklist","description":"Before approaching the Moodle plugins directory and submitting your plugin (or a new plugin version), you are encouraged to go through the checklists below and fix eventual issues with your plugin.

Of course it is fine to have documentation elsewhere, such as the Github wiki, however one advantage of including documentation in the English Moodle Docs is that \'Moodle Docs for this page\' links in Moodle (when logged in as a teacher or admin) can lead directly to your plugin documentation (as explained in the Header and footer documentation). And, very important, it will then be very easy for translators of Moodle Docs to add translations for this information.","permalink":"/moodledevdocs/general/community/plugincontribution/documentation"},{"id":"community/plugincontribution/guardians/qaprechecks","title":"Plugin QA prechecks","description":"Plugin QA prechecks are for testing the functionality of plugins submitted for approval in the Moodle Plugins directory.
